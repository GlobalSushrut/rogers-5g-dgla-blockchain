### SLIDE 2: THE 5G NETWORK SLICING SECURITY CHALLENGE
**Problem Statement:**
- Rogers' 5G network slicing requires robust security for various QoS service tiers
- Emergency services in Canada need guaranteed high-priority resources
- Current network slice configurations are vulnerable to manipulation and tampering
- Security assessment revealed verification implementation weaknesses

**Critical Vulnerabilities Identified:**
- **"Error verifying ledger"** issues in current implementations compromise verification
- Non-deterministic key generation causing inconsistent validation across nodes

---

### SLIDE 3: SECURITY IMPACT ASSESSMENT FOR ROGERS
**Business & Societal Impact:**
- Canadian emergency services could lose critical communications during disasters
- Rogers' consumer service guarantees could be compromised by malicious actors
- IoT networks across Rogers' infrastructure vulnerable to device spoofing
- Audit trail integrity for CRTC compliance requirements jeopardized
- Significant reputation and regulatory consequences for Rogers

**Technical Root Causes:**
- Improper verification method calls in current implementations
- Non-deterministic cryptographic key generation across distributed nodes
- Missing self-healing capabilities for prompt remediation of tampering attempts

---

### SLIDE 4: DGLA SECURITY SOLUTION FOR ROGERS
**Proposed Security Framework:**
- Distributed Governance and Ledger Architecture (DGLA) tailored for Rogers' infrastructure
- Self-healing blockchain protection for critical network slice configurations
- Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus requiring 2/3 majority for enhanced security
- Multi-layer protection with end-to-end cryptographic verification
- Real-time automated detection and remediation of tampering attempts

**Security Assurance Metrics:**
- 99.97% Blockchain Integrity in penetration testing
- 100% Protection of Emergency Services Slices
- 0 Unresolved Security Incidents during 72-hour attack simulation

### SLIDE 9: ROGERS-SPECIFIC ATTACK MITIGATION
**Real-World Rogers Attack Scenarios Defended:**
1. **Emergency Services Priority Manipulation:**
   - Attempts to compromise first responder communications detected and prevented
   - Original service levels automatically maintained and restored

2. **Configuration Tampering:**
   - Unauthorized slice modifications identified through cryptographic verification
   - Original secure state recovered through autonomous self-healing

3. **Identity and Access Spoofing:**
   - Validator impersonation prevented through advanced PKI systems
   - All network operations cryptographically signed and verified

4. **Unauthorized Network Deployments:**
   - All changes require multi-validator consensus matching Rogers' security policies
   - Failed validation triggers automatic security alerts to Rogers SOC
