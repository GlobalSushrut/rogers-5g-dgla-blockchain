# Rogers 5G DGLA Blockchain Infrastructure

## Project Summary
This repository contains the complete architectural documentation and code implementation for the Rogers 5G DGLA (Distributed Governance and Ledger Architecture) blockchain infrastructure. The system provides secure, tamper-evident network slice management with self-healing capabilities.

## Key Security Features
- ✅ **Fixed Verification Method**: Corrected `verify_chain_integrity()` implementation
- ✅ **Deterministic Keys**: Using `NB_KEY_5G_*` format for consistent verification
- ✅ **Self-healing Blockchain**: Auto-repair system for tamper detection and remediation
- ✅ **Enhanced Error Handling**: Detailed logging and proper error states

## Implementation Files

Key implementation files available in this repository:

- `chain_repair.py` - Implements blockchain self-healing system
- `key_fix.py` - Deterministic key implementation for verification
- `block_repair.py` - Block-level repair functions

## Real-World Impact

This DGLA implementation ensures the integrity of Rogers' 5G network slices, particularly for:

1. **Emergency Services** - Guaranteed slice priority and tamper-proof resource allocation
2. **Consumer Services** - Protected against downgrade with auditable QoS
3. **IoT Networks** - Secure device registration with immutable authorization

## Next Steps

1. Implement CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
2. Deploy multi-node validator network
3. Enhance security hardening with PKI and role-based access controls
4. Develop visualization dashboards for operational monitoring
