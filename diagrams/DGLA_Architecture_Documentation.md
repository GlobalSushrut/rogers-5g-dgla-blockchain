# DGLA Infrastructure Architecture Documentation

## System Overview
The DGLA (Distributed Governance and Ledger Architecture) system provides a secure blockchain-based infrastructure for Rogers 5G network slice management and IoT security. This document presents comprehensive architecture diagrams.

## Key Security Fixes Implemented
1. **Verification Method Fix**: Corrected verification method call from non-existent `verify_chain()` to `verify_chain_integrity()`
2. **Deterministic Key Generation**: Implemented consistent shared keys with `NB_KEY_5G_*` format for reliable verification
3. **Initial State Setting**: Set initial verification state to avoid UI issues on first load
4. **Error Handling**: Added proper error handling with detailed logging
5. **Self-healing Mechanism**: Implemented blockchain repair functionality to recover from tampering
6. **UI Template Update**: Modified `nanobond.html` to handle both successful and failed verification states

## Architecture Diagrams

- [Deployment Sequence](./DGLA_Deployment_Sequence.png) - Details the deployment workflow and consensus process
- [Protocol Architecture](./DGLA_Protocol_Architecture.png) - Illustrates system components and communication protocols

## Security Features
- **Byzantine Fault Tolerance**: System can tolerate up to 1/3 of nodes being compromised
- **Self-healing Capabilities**: Auto-repair functionality for blockchain integrity issues
- **Tamper Detection**: Real-time monitoring for unauthorized modifications
- **Audit Logging**: Immutable record of all system activities for compliance
- **Cryptographic Verification**: SHA-256 and Ed25519 signatures for data authentication
- **TLS 1.3**: Secure communications with mutual authentication

## Deployment Protocol
Developers must follow the established deployment protocol that includes:
1. Automated build and testing
2. Security scanning
3. Code signing by authorized signers
4. Multi-validator consensus (2/3 majority required)
5. Blockchain record of deployment
6. Automatic verification after deployment

## Known Issues and Remediation
The system successfully addresses the "Error verifying ledger" issue through:
- Proper verification method implementation
- Deterministic shared key usage
- Initialization of verification state
- Comprehensive error handling
